# Content & Community Guidelines

**Last updated:** 26 December 2025

Favz is a platform for collecting, organizing, and sharing inspirations, ideas, and useful content.  
To keep Favz safe and welcoming, all users must follow these Content & Community Guidelines.

These rules apply to **all user-generated content**, including text, links, images, lists, and items — especially content made public.

---

By using Favz, you agree to:
- Share content responsibly
- Respect other users
- Comply with applicable laws

If you are unsure whether content is allowed, **do not post it publicly**.

## 2. Prohibited Content
You may **not** upload, share, or make public any content that includes or promotes:

### Sexual Content

---

## 3. Public vs Private Content
- **Private content** is visible only to you and carries lower risk

If you choose to make content public, you accept increased responsibility for what you share.

---

## 4. Images
Images uploaded to Favz must:
- Be appropriate for a general audience
- Not contain nudity, sexual acts, or extreme violence
- Not depict abuse, exploitation, or illegal activities

Images may be automatically or manually reviewed.

---

## 5. Links
You are responsible for any links you share.

Links must not:
- Lead to pornographic or violent websites
- Promote illegal activities
- Mislead users or hide malicious intent

Reported links may be removed or blocked.

---

## 6. Reporting Content
Favz provides tools to report public content that violates these Guidelines.

When content is reported, we may:
- Temporarily hide the content
- Review it manually
- Remove it permanently
- Take action against the responsible account

Abuse of the reporting system may also result in action.

---

## 7. Enforcement
We reserve the right to:
- Remove or restrict content at any time
- Suspend or permanently ban accounts
- Take action without prior notice

Repeated or severe violations may result in permanent removal from Favz.

Moderation decisions are final.

---

## 8. Responsibility
Favz does not pre-moderate all content.  
Users are solely responsible for the content they upload or share.

However, we take reports seriously and act promptly when violations are identified.

---

## 9. Updates to These Guidelines
We may update these Guidelines from time to time.

Continued use of Favz after changes means you accept the updated version.
